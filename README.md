# GroundMeshes

**Note: This addon has been deprecated and the functionality merged to the FurtherPrimitivesCollection addon.**
This addon adds a submenu to the Add -> Add Mesh menu in Blender, where the user can add cubes, cylinders and cones to the scene, such that their origin is at the bottom of the mesh. Developed on Blender version 3.6.5. The latest version can be downloaded from https://github.com/LStefanCoder/GroundMeshes.

## Use

The groundmeshes.py file should be installed separately, not as a zip file. Open the Add Menu in object mode, and go to "Add mesh", where there is an additional menu item at the bottom: "Origin at the base". This item contains seven options.

## Options

- **Cube**: adds a default cube
- **Cylinder (32)**: adds a cylinder with 32 vertices
- **Cylinder (64)**: adds a cylinder with 64 vertices
- **Cylinder (128)**: adds a cylinder with 128 vertices
- **Cone (32)**: adds a cone with 32 vertices
- **Cone (64)**: adds a cone with 64 vertices
- **Cone (128)**: adds a cone with 128 vertices

## Notes

The addon only works in Object mode.
